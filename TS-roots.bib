  abstract = {It is well-known that the pseudoinverse Newton-Raphson method converges locally if the rank of the Jacobian matrix is constant. A weaker assumption is considered: a set of zeros Z is a smooth manifold of dimension k, and the rank of the Jacobian is exactly n−k at all zeros. Low-rank approximation of the Jacobian matrix is used. It is proved that Newton-Raphson quadratically converges in this case. Also, the predictor-corrector approach can be used to trace a curve of zeros if k=1. The application considered belongs to the field of computer-aided geometric design. The method is applied to trace a curve of tangential intersection of two parametric surfaces. Some experimental results are shown, suggesting that the method is stable.},
